# Reading-Notes7 Programming with Javascript

In this reading, it begins by talking about some instances of when, say, the user leaves a field blank. So it is a conditional structure, dependent on the condition of the users answer, and if there is no answer, a prompt is created so they finish.

Using “if…else”:

If (field==empty) {
prompUser();
} else {
submitForm();
}

Above it is calling the user to submit form unless there is an empty field.

A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

I am including the example straight from the reading because, quite frankly, it helps me learn. So, credit to “W3” for this:

Function example:

Function myFuntion(p1, p2) {
Return p1 * p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2}

The function will happen (execute) when the function is called (invoked). A user may click a button, may call from JS code, or automatically self-invoked.
The function will stop executing (end?) she there is a return statement reached. (Back to caller).

These are great because the code can be used over and over. Saving time which is saving money!

Some examples of operators in JavaScript are

= assigns a variable
+ adds
 * multiplies
And there is a chart that goes in further detail in W3’s tutorial

Stings are in ““.
5 + 5 + “62” = 1062. For instance.
