## React Docs - Thinking in React

1. The single responsibility principle is a way to decide what should be its own component. A technique used to decide if one should create a new function or object, the "single responsibility principle" being one. This states that the component should ideally do one thing. If it grows, it will develop subcomponents.

2. Static version would be a version using props but not state.

3. Once the static version is in place, add state.

4. To determine if it is state, here are 3 questions:
    1. Is it passed in from a parent via props?
    2. Does it remain unchanged over time?
    3. Can you compute it based on any other state orprops in your component?

All of the above, if yes, it is (most likely) not state.

5 Where a state needs to live can be identified by finding components that render something based on the state. Or finding common owner or another component highter up in hierarchy, Can create a component that is used only to hold the state, and make sure to add it in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher-Order Functions

1. Higher-order functions: functions that operate onother functions. Either by taking them as arguments, or by returning them.

Line 2 is saying return m if it is greater than n. Or is it the beginning of an argument.

3. Map and Reduce are methods on arrays. Within the function, they are a function as an argument.
