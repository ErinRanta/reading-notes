## What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This is such a fascinating piece. I realy related to Rozovsky at the begining, as I have been weary of groups because of bossy, loud mouthed people who do not enjoy listening (that is in the past,...my experiences now are QUITE delightful) and always one-upping the others.

So intruiging that there is a study of the perfect team. It never is quite what one would think.

I can see how companies will benefit by teams, basically work will be produced quicker and has more eyes on it. I wonder, is it possible to have a map for the perfect team though? Or is it like "why is the restaurant busy? Everyone is out because it is sunny or everyone is not going out to eat because it is sunny." It just maybe is a bit coincadence w=once you get past the notion of wanting a mix of introverts and extroverts.

What about when the introvert they studied shows their extroverted side?

And just as I wrote that above, I read the part of the piece that said they could not find a throughline. 

People will change when they begin to get comfortable with the team, and even more when they are really comfortable!

I am excited to hear that a lot of developer work is team based. I think it is important to get many perspectives. And eyes on such detailed work.

I just do not necessariy believe a formula will help pick the perfect team. It can help, but the people's characters are what will make or break the team.
