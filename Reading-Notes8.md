## Operators and Loops


There are multiple types of operators in **JavaScript** (10 I believe) and I will touch comparison operators and assignment operators.

There are 8 operator symbols in comparison operators. The comparison operator compares its operands and returns what is based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numbers, string, logic,  or object.

Assignment operators, when an operator is assigned by = . The value on the left is assigned the value on the right. Many compound assignment operators exist as well.

For Statement and While Statement Loops are 2 of many loop options. They all have one thing in common, they repeat an action multiple times. For statement loops repeats until the specific condition hits false. While loops execute as long as the specified condition is true. Make sure to avoid infinite loops with no false option.
