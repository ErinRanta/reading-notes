# Markdown: what is it?

## Markdown is another way to make a simple website that I did not now existed! 


You may picture a slew of confusing looking symbols and repetitive lines of abbreviations when you think about making a site. 
Markdown is in between regular text, and that version I just mentioned. There are symbols and codes, but it is a bit less....daunting to the new eye.
I think of it as a way to comprise a rough draft of something you would like to add on to with more details later.

At first, I thought "why not just learn HTML (the "main" code language for basic text)? Well, Markdown can be a nice intermediate step that is used more frequently than I would have guessed.

Some examples:

1. Placing 2 *'s before and after a word makes the word **bold**.
2. Ordered lists, like this one, is done by simply putting 1,2,3 etc on front of the word, whereas in HTML it is more involved.
3. Images are placed by putting the name/title of the image in [] then I dragged the image two lines below.
