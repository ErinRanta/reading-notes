## Functional Programming Concepts

Wikipedia says, "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data."

a pure function returns the same results with given the same arguments. Does not cause any observable side effects. Benefits of pure function being that one knows what to expect.

Immuntability, "Changing over time, or unable to be changed."
