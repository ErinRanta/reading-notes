## API Design Best Practices

REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

REST API's are designed around resources. Any type of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

'https://adventure-works.com/orders/1' is the example the article gave for an example of an identifier. Something that can identify the resourse (I am assuming beyond a big set of numbers).

The most common HTTP verbs are: **GET,** **POST,** **PUT,** ** PATCH,** and **DELETE.**

Like the identifier, it should describe what the resource is. ex: 'HTTP/:dental-works.com/'

It is not ideal to have a "chatty" API, as it exposes many small resources. I believe this means it makes it a pain for the client, they have to visit a variety of resources.

GET returns 200 if successful.

Unsuccessful GET returns 404

A successful POST returns 201.

DELETE is looking for the return of 204.
