## Reading-Notes 4, Course 201

### Chapter 4, "Links" from Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS Book

Links are the one thing that allow user to move from website to website with ease.. They also allow users to move within a website to specific locations,
ioen a browser in a new window, and start an email & address with a new email 9JD).

In HTML, links are creaated wih the <a> tag. Within that tag is href=, and the url goes after the =.

THe main difference from linking to other sites and within sites is within there is no need for specifying the domain name.

Relative links can occur within same site.

Speaking of strucure and organization, it is a good odea to order code bu using new folders, aka directories.
They first/top one would be parent (sometimes grandparent), then there are children directories.

### Layout

Creating eye-pleasing layouts, and figuring out how to write that for the page is in thia chapter.
Positioning elements with CSS consistes of Building Blocks, Containing Elements and there are positioning schemes that allow the control (normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute poitioning...also fixed positioning and floating elements).

I am extremely interested in how this comes to be: fitting everything for the various size devices that exist.
Layouts, grids, and frameworks are used to control elements of the page.

Sometimes there will need to be multiple stye sheets, one for color, one for layout etc. (I like this idea).
Some beautiful example layout pages with code are in this chapter!

### "Functions, Methods, and Objects" from Duckett's Javascript & Jquery Book

Functions, methods, and objects are used by programmers to organize code. browsers require such detailed instructions.

Functions are basically a group of instructions that can be reused in the code.
declare the function, then call it in order for it to be run.
Calling a function:

testcall();

at the end of the function instructions.

Sometimes while declaring a function, the information that is needed can be placed in the brackets in top line, for instance:

function tryTest(width, height) {
    return width * height;
  }  

Functions can end up with a single value, or multiple.

I did not realize that each varialbe created takes more memory, and global variables use more memory!


### Paired Programming!

This article seems very atune to the real world. Working as a pair has immense benefits. Multiple eyes, multiple views, energy that is different that if working alone.
Harder to get off track!

Four key components to learn a new language:

1. Listening
2. Speaking
3. Reading
4. Writing

Working in a pair touches on all of these.

Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work enviroment rediness can all be helped by pair programming (says the article author, Allie Grampa).
