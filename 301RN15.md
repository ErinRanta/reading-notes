## What is OAuth

1. "OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization," -states the article. It is a secure way to keep data safe.

2. An example is when one is given a token to sign in with. 

3. The steps include:

-User shows intent
-Consumer gets permission
-User is redirected to the service provider
-The user gives permission.
-The consumer obtains an access token
The consumer accesses the protected resourse!

4.OpenID is basically when the user logs in as authentication. Now has become an authentication layet for OAuth.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

1. The difference between authorizitation and authetication is that authentication verifies the user, while authoritization determines the rights they have to access.

2. Authoritization Code Flow is a server side process where one exchanges authoritization code for a token.

3. Authoritization Code Flow = PkCe is a flow that is designed to authenticate mobile users.

4. Implicit flow is intended for public clients. Those who are unable to store client secrets. Not as widely practiced, but keeps things swift if the app only needs an ID token.

5. Authorizes the machine instead of the user in machine-machine transactions.

6. Basically, device to device security. For instance, when logging in, one will be asked to enter a text from pne's phone (or seperate device).

7. Resource Owner Password Flow is a second place method to Auth. Code Flow. The user provides credentials using an interactive form.
