## How I explained REST to my brother

Roy Fielding is one of the main, founding authors of HTTP

It ended up being that talking to all computers in the World was not a requirement, and what was was talking to a smaller group of machines.

HTTP Protocol is about "applying verbs to nouns".

Such as: "get". The browser does an HTTP get on the URL the user types and returns a page.

"Post" adds something to another system, and "put" to replace. For a partial update, HTTP "patch" is used.
