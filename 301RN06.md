## An Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime a program we can use to execute JavaScript.

The V8 engine is running in many browsers and it compiles JavaScript so your computer can execute. I believe that V8 isalready there for when node.js is installed node can work with the V8.

Runtime is the stage of a lifecycle of programming. The time that the program takes while running all of the drections for execution.

Npm is a JavaScript package manager.

I am running node version 18.4.1

I am running npm version 8.12.1

npm install -g jshint is what is used to install jshint

Node is used to run various build tools. Helps automate making a JavaScript app!

The 6 reasons for pair programming are:

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work enviroment readiness

I have found the learning from other students, collaboration, and efficiency ALL very valuable!

Paired programming works where one person is "driver" and the other is "navigator". The navigator basically tells the driver wat to type. Then they take turns. There can be some conversation and interchanging of ideas during the process though.
