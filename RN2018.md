## Flexbox

Flexbox has a descriptive name...it's flexible! ha. M
Responsive layour can be put by the parent.
Elements can shrink dngrow to for space.
Layouts can be in any direction. Wrap or no-wrap.
Can collapse, and have order display reversed.
Child elements can be aligned with their parents OR next to eachother!
Content can be displayed in rows or columns.

The main axis and cross axis are keys to this flexbox. If main axis runs horixontal, cross axis runs other direction than the main.
re-ordering only happens in visual order, so is not the best for accessability!

## CSS Layout - Flexbox:

Flexbox o=ver float:
More capability to morpgh with the size of the box and allow mmore movement.
Wrappping overflow can be stopped.
Can be rows or columns.
Items will "morph" inside container.

First select which elements will be laid as flexible boxws with flex in CSS.
The items will be flex items inside the flex container. 
Default is set to row, but can change direction to column simply by adding comumn to flex-direction.
Can add wrap to the section so overflow does not happen.

This topic onnects with my longterm goals because Flexbox seems extremely useful, and to be able to put content out that it is more confident that it will not be "messed up" on the page is everything!
I am very interested in aesthetic pages and how aesthetics connect to the user, so this seems to support that.

## Things I waould like more information on:
Practice! More time to practice. Then the questions will arise. I would love to learn flexbox.
