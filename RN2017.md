# Reading Notes 7, Course 201

## Domain Modeling:

"Domain modeling is th eprocess of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem," Sam Hamm. commonly referred to as **object-oriented model**, this is a communication tool . Can speak to technical AND business sides.

Helps determine data that can be useful!

Constructor functions are used to define properties between many objects. The properties are the same.When the constructor function is called, the data is stored in properties. Then initiated with new keyword.
Object-oriented programming: the new keyword instantiates.. 2. The constructor initiates. 3. Object stored in variable for later.

## HTML Table Basics:

A Table is a great way to visually see and compare data. We have all used tables in our life somehow.Evem the cencus in 1800 used a table. The table in HTML just allows this on the web page!
Tables not used for page layouts. Trying to put various headers, content, footer, etc.won't work because they will most likely look different on different browsers and screens.

3 semantic HTML elements used in table are: table, tbody, tr.

Constuctors are used to create multiple objects without rewriting the code over and over. Using new keyword, it creates object, bind "this" to the new object, code will run then the new object is returned.

By convention only do constructors start with capital letter.

 Inheritance allows prototypes to access properties fron other objects. A different way to use class.

 ## Things I would like to know more about:
 The last question! I would like more information on the prototype inheritence. Maybe with different example.
