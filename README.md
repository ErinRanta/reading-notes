# Hello! Welcome to my reading notes, part 1.

#### My name is Erin, I live in NYC, am a Mom of one daughter and 2 dogs, and a wife of a chef. As a former Pilates Instructor and sobriety coach, I am studying so I do a full 180 in careers, and could not be more excited. New passions, here I come! [HERE](https://github.com/ErinRanta) is my GitHub profile page.

I am excited to work with a **growth mindset**. It will support us all in the following ways:

- Look at challenging moments as opportunities for growth
- Knowing that if someone is succesful, it is inspiring, not a threat
- It does not matter ones backgroundeveryone can learn!

### Looking forward to working with everyone! ðŸ˜ƒ
