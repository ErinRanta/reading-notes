# Hello! Welcome to my reading notes.

## A little bit about me:

 My name is Erin, I live in NYC, am a Mom of one daughter, 2 dogs, and a wife of a chef. As a former *Pilates Instructor* and *sobriety coach*, I am studying so I can do a full 180 in careers, and could not be more excited. New passions, here I come! [HERE](https://github.com/ErinRanta) is my GitHub profile page.
