# Reading Notes 6 (JavaScript)

JavaScript (different from Java Programming Language) is a lightweight scripting language. Since I am talking to my friend that is non-technical, it is the language that programmers use for really bringing the page to life! In JS the user now can become involved, versus simply looking and reading.
Most websites that you have used to buy tickets, do a poll, add information,…those are most likely from JavaScript.
Think about that next time you go to order delivery…the boxes where you add “how many sauces” are made from JS (most likely).


Input and Output are one way to make JS interactive. Input is when the user replies or types something, and the output is what is then presented on the screen.

Variables are important, as they are containers for storing data. Variables can be declared (or how about called) let, const, and var, but var is never used anymore, so let us say “let” and “const”

Identifiers are names that are unique that help identify variables. They are case sensitive and can help the process make a bit more sense (real talk!). 

Another key fact is the “=“ does not equal “equals” in JS. It is used to assign something. == is “equal to” and I believe === is “REALLY equal to”.
1st, declare a variable. 
Let favoriteFoods;
Then, assign a value to the variable,
favoriteFoods = “cheese”;
Or
Assign a variable WHEN you declare:
Let favoriteFood = **“cheese:"**

Note “It os good programming to declare variables at the beginning of a script.”

One last thing for now…..a variable cannot be re-declared with let or const.

There is a lot to this, and it helps me to discuss it in “regular” language!
