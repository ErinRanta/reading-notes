## Component-Based Architecture

1. A **component** is a way of communication. It is "modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable'" (-the article), which is intended to interact with other components

2. Characteristics of components include: *Reusability*, *Replaceable*, *Not context specific*, *Extensible*, *Encapsulated*, and *Independant*.

3. There are many advantages of using component based architecture. Deployment is easier, cost is reduced, the fact that they are reusable is great. Modic=fication of technical complexity, reliability, and helpful for system maintenance (can change without affecting entire system).

What are props? How are they used in React?

The article was not opening, but I searched. I found that props are short for properties.
They are used to pass data from one component to another. Often from a parent to child component.
Props are helpful for supporting dynamic data flow.

## Things I would Like to know more about:

I look forward to real-life examples of the component characteristics.
