# Reading Notes 5, Course 201

## Readings: Images, Color, and Text

### "HTML Media"

1. The 'alt' attribute is used to decribe images that may not render on the screen for one reason or another. It is helpful so the user is not stuck looking at "null" or a blank space.

2. Accessibility can be improved by the above mentioned 'alt' attribute. Also, thoughtful HTML decriptions can be placed in the document for people who can not see the image. There can be voice activated programs to read the text.

3. 'Figure' element would be useful when there is something that is not necessarily in the "flow" of the page. Say there is a box or image off to the side with some extra or special information.

4. 'gif' would be an image that is affected by the size of the screen, and the quality would look either good or bad depending on if it looks "pixelated" or not. 'svg' the image will look crisp on all screens...pgone, laptop, you name it!

5. I would choose 'svg' because you never know what device will be opening up the screenshot!

### "Learn CSS"

1. The foreground is...I think of it as...what catches the eye first. If a page was 3-d, the letters and lines come forward first. Background is what these sit upon. Background supports the foreground. Like a bed.

2. I would ask my friend what her blog is about. I would choose colors that align with her message. Colors can make a world of difference, so this would be very important for my friend's site.

3. I would choose fonts that are aesthetcally pleasing, and go with the motif and color scheme. Also, fonts that are accessable in all browsers and that do not mess up sizing and spacing when size is changed by a user.

4. 'font-size', 'font-weight' and 'font-style' all change the look of the font...size can push the borders of the text box and need to be careful with nested fonts. Can be pixels, or in relation to the parent element. Weight can change the bold-ness, and style is used to turn italic on or off.

5. I could space around characters in an h1 element by using text-align, and/or line-height. Also, the p tag.

### Things I would like to Know More About...

Color Theory! I love colors, and what they can do to ones moods and senses. I would like to experiement with colors, especially as I get more comfortable with CSS.
