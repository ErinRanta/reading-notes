## Local Storage and How to Use it on Websites

A developer would use local storage for a website because the information stays when the application is closed. Versus the http method, the system refreshes and basically starts from scratch again. It reminds me of living alone vs. living with someone...when living alone you know your apartment (or house) will be as it was when you left (ahhh the good old days of living alone lol).

Sensitive, personal information should NOT be stored in local storage. Things such as bank account information, social security numbers, and anything you do not want miscellaneous people to have access to. There will always be people out there hacking into local storage everywhere.

Locan storage can be stored as a strings indifferent keys. So, if there is an object, it may not be stored right away(I am assuming because it will need to go through a process first). The code can be teste din the console to see if it is stored as [object Object] or the actual object. Ny using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods this can be worked around. An example is given:

var car = {};
car.wheels = 4;
car.doors = 2;
car.sound = 'vroom';
car.name = 'Lightning McQueen';
console.log( car );
localStorage.setItem( 'car', car );
console.log( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) );

Will then use the JSON() method:

var car = {};
car.wheels = 4;
car.doors = 2;
car.sound = 'vroom';
car.name = 'Lightning McQueen';
console.log( car );
localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) );
console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );

The results will show in the console.

## Things I would Like to Know More About:

Is this mostly only done with data applications? Or, is moving storage to local something to do always?
