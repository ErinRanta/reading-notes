## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting Javascript

Syntax errors are errors from the keyboard like spelling or punctuation. Syntax is a language, and it like not writing the language properly. Whereas Logic errors are when the language (syntax) has no errors but the choice of code is not correct for the problem.

I have run across plenty of errors in my short time learning this. A lot of extra spaces that the linter picks out. I have had errors when an image was not linked properly. I have encountered errors in the terminal, and tat can be solved by deciphering the message, but I am still learning.

This topic will influence my long term goals because I am really starting to see the impotance of specificity and clarity. Everything DOES matter. And as for logic, to be sure and practice / test code before committing, especially if not sure.

## The Javascript Debugger

The debugger is in the developer tools section, which is a section that I did not know was there until a month ago when I began 102. 3 weeks actually. Anyhow, there is the "debugger" which allows one to "watch the value of variables and set breakpoints," and other places in the code that may want to be watched. It helps identify problems! The de-bugger de-bugs!

In the dev tools area, the breakpoint lists the areas the code breakpoints. The call stack shows what code was executed to get the current line. It allows you to really see when the code happened, and check it if is correct, or as it was intended to be.
