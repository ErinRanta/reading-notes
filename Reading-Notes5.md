# 5. CSS

## When creating a website, after Wireframing and HTML, CSS is added.

### Cascading Style Sheets is when color, font, style…things that start to bring the page to life. 
 
 I have heard that CSS can be frustrating, and not everyone’s favorite. As I am just getting to know HTML and CSS, I enjoy the fact that color is introduced and there is more of an opportunity for expression. When deciding the elements for CSS on a page, sometimes it is one’s opinion, not just an absolute equation. I think that makes it interesting, and helps feed my artistic side. 

My project for this class, however, I would like to offer a huge disclaimer. I learn by practicing over and over (and over!) and this is so new that I do not have the skills to execute how I see it in my head, but when I do, CSS will be a favorite.

CSS can be either added in line with HTML, in a separate section on an HTML file, or a file of its own that is then added to the HTML file. The ladder option is the more widely used option, especially as projects grow in size and multiple people are working on the same project.
