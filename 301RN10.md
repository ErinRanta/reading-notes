## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

A 'call' is invoking a function.

One call can happen at a time, runing top to bottom.

LIFO is "Last In, First Out" and it means that the last function to be pushed into the stack will be the first to pop out. So kind of opposite of perhaps a natural order of when something enters first they leave first.

function firstFunction(){
  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  console.log("The end from secondFunction");
}

secondFunction();

So above (diagram from the reading): the second function is called allows an open space for first function to be pushed up. Then the second function, then it is cleared.

Stack Overflow happens when a function calls itself without an exit point.

## JavaScript error messages

1. Reference error: When one uses a variable not yet defined. When use let after const. Several examples.

2. Syntax error: Anything that goes against the particular syntax that is being used.

3. Range error: When the length manipulated and given does not match.

4. Type error: When sing the 'wrong' datatype.

5. Breakpoint: Like a checkpoint. Can be conditional. Can be used to help debug. "Only move forward with 'action b' if 'action a' is 'fill in the blank'.

6. Debugger: adds a breakpoint in code.
