# Course 301 Reading Notes #12

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

100's are informational status codes.

200's a winning codes! Success. Not a guarantee that the request is fully processed, but in that step it was successful.

300's are for redirection.

400's are cient error! Invalid requests for the server.

500's server error codes. at times temporary, other times permanent.

202 means it was valid, but will finish in the future, as it is asynchronous, so the timing may not be exact.

308 tells client to use a different URL.

204 is used if the client did not get the correct data returned.

304 for a resource that used to exist but no longer does.

Forbidden status (403), basically no permissions to the resource.

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB

We put our MongoDB string into .env because we can pull in enviroment variables that are sensitive and can ignore them in .gitignore

Middleware code that runs when server gets request, but before it goes to the routes.

app.use(express.json()) parses JSON requests, then puts data in the reuest. It is a middleware.

In a route, /:id is a parameter, giving access to what is passed in after slash.

Put requires the entire resource to update, while Patch requires only parts of the representation. Patch, updat eonly what the subscriber updates (not everything).

A default value in a schema is made by defaulting to current date.
