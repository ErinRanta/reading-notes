## nosql vs sql

Five differences between SQL and NoSQL

SQL__________________________NoSql

SQL are relational / NoSQL are non-relational (disturbed)

SQL are table based / NoSql are based in documents, key-value pairs, graphs.

SQL are vertically scalable / NoSql are horizontally scalable.

SQL databases are: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, MS-SQL / NoSQL include: mMngoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

SQL databases classify as open-source or closed-source from commercial vendors. NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data in grapg, document-store, ans XML databases.

NoSqL good for social media, cloud, big data requirements. SQL more individual. Everything is conected in SQL.

NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage.

Both are good for scalability.

## sql vs nosql

SQL stands for: Structured Query Language

Relational database is a db that stores access points that are all related. They have something in commmon.

Relational database works with logical data structures

A 'schema' is like a blueprint of the datatbase.

NoSql database are non-tabular. The data is stored in documents.

Mongo database contains BSON documents. Data records, gathered in colections.

Mongo is more flexible. It is easier to acquire data. One does not have to use the same scheme for the collection of documents. One can add new data easier as well.

NoSql may not be as 'safe' because of the easier approach for obtaining data. Not as standardized, so while that has perks, it can be a challenge as well.
