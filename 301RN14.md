## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

Women were seen less and less in the computer science field when games were ,arketing towards boys. Parents would buy boys computers, not girls. It was when home computers became available.

It matters that makes had been playing on computers more while growing up because they had an edge above girls, who even though may have been interested and talented, were not given the opportunity.

Diversity efforts are most successful when it comes, wholeheartedly, from the top. Top meaning the Founders, CEOs, leaders of the company. When these people take the time to learn why it is so important to cultivate a diverse team, and how to do that (with avoiding tokenism!!).

Diverse companies preform better because more lived experience is brought to the table. More ideas from a plethera of backgrounds will therefore allow the product to reach more. Diverse teams are smarter and way more creative. This will transcend to the customer. 

A diverse company better contain a diverse team if they are trying to bring a product tothe world and hope all people buy it. There is no way a product can transcend the lack of genuine lived experience and be authentic in its reach to all.
