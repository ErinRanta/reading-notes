# HTML

We have been learning about how to build a website from scratch! The first step is kind of like what an architect may do with a house…find a way to get a blueprint of structure. This is wireframing. Some hand draw the sections of the page, others use programs to create. Better to use a companion program if more than one person working on it.

Then, most always, HTML is added. This stands for  **“Hypertext Markup Language”** which is quite a dramatic name! It’s really not dramatic, though, those design components that bring drama (or whatever feeling you are going for) will come later. 

HTML is, with the wireframe, the structure of the site.  What text goes where.
It is written in “elements” in which the context is in between tags. There’s an opening tag and closing tag. All of the text is within the framework therefore it transfers in a way the developer can control and the computer can read.
