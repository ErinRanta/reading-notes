## Video and Audio on the Web:

The main thing that has changed since the early 2000's in regards to video and audio is that now it can be embedded into a site, whereas before an extra plugin was needed.

Src is the path to the video, just like it does for img in html. Controls, or the apprropriate Javascript API must include a way to stop and adjust volume.
Fallback content is so important in case the browser cannot access the page!

I am not sure what it means to write a story where audio and video are characters. I can think of ideas where audiio and video would be useful...

## A Complete Guide to Grid:

Flex is more one-dimensional, whereas Grid is two-dimensional. THey would be a great pair, and work well together.

Grid container is the direct parent of the grid items. THe item on which is on display. THe item is direct cild of the container (not sub-item). Grid lines are the dividing lines in the grid!

## Responsive Images:

Images would benefit from being responsive so they work on all screens! There are so many sizes of screens out there these days.

While <img> points to a single file, <srcset> and <sizes> provide source images along with hints for the browser. 

There is a lot more flexibibilty with <srcset> and options vs JS and CSS.
