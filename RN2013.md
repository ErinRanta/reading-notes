# Course 201, Reading-Notes 3
## Resource: Jon Duckett's books "HTML & CSS" and "Javascript & JQuery"

### Chapter 3, "Lists"

In this chapter, lists are discussed. 
in HTML, there are ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists<dl>
There are also nested lists, which is a sub list nested within a list.

If it is an ordered list, it will show with numbers. Unordered, will be with bullets.

### Chapter 13, "Boxes"

Boxes around text can be made in CSS. They can be measured in pixels or percentage.
Using ems or percentages can help with adapting to various screen sizes, but pixels is the most popular.
To add a box, include dimensions. Width, Height, padding, border, margin. Choose what type of border.
Hidden can take overflow of content from the box and hide it.
There is some very cool stuff that can be done with shadowing the boxes and rounding the corners of the box that I can not wait to try!

## "Basic Javascript Instructions"

Arrays! An array is a set of values that is related to each other (JD).
When creating, can store string, boolean, and/or number int eh same array.
Array starts at zero (not one)!
Place one is one place from zero.

## "Decisions and Loops"

If, else statements can be so useful! I can imagine, at least. I can imagine forms use this a lot. in this chapter we learn about switch statements. A switch has a default option if nothing is chosen.
Also, coercion & weak typing, Turthy & Falsy values.
There are certain values that are considered Falsy, and some that are considered Truthy. For instance, a variable with no value will be Falsy.

There are a few loops that repeat a set of statements such as:

1. For
2. While
3. Do While


THe book includes a beautiful rendering of a loop on page 172-73. It shows the cycles of the loop and when (and what) will be written on the page.
