# Hello,

As I am new to this field, I am pretty much talking to myself as the **“non-tech”** friend, and learning in the process!

A text editor is something I would have thought was for writers/authors, journalists.

Come to find out, it is **quite an important** tool to have for coding! I have learned this by even practicing when the tags are filled in (code completion). That is awesome, especially with the repetitive nature of some entires.

It has helped with learning the syntax, as the formatting is set up. Also, the immediate preview is helpful.

Moving to another new venture for me: the terminal! The first hour of learning about it was daunting, and the commands scared me. I would not even move it across the screen, ha!

It is something that is yet another “language” but is quite powerful and feels fantastic when things run as hoped.
