# Reading Notes 6, Course 201

## Objects

1. An object is a grouping of characteristics. It is a way for the programmer to explaing to the computer how to describe the....object (a person, a thing...).

2. Object literals are a more efficient way to apply a list of different (say, people) vs entering all of the information each time. “easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name,” -MD Web Docs

3. With bracket notation it is like an array where you are identifying the placement of the property using the descriptor (vs index number). So if it is important to know what place in order it is. It can set information dynamically.

4. For more than one object literal, "this" allows the same definition for each object literal. In the sample code this stands for dogs name that can change. 

## DOM

The "Document Object Model" is a "programming interface for web documents."
It allows the page to be able to let programs change structure, style, and content. Programming languages can interact with the page **because** the DOM represents the page as nodes and objects.
The DOM allows a page to appear as a website or an HTML document.
The DOM is built with multiple APIs.

The DOM is a connector of sorts that allows Javascript to happen. It is not part of Javascript language. From what I gather, Javascrpt can run on DOM but can also run with node API.

## Things I would like to know more about:
See objects in a literal, real life usage...what is it used for that I currently use?
Some clarity on DOM...am I reading this correctly?
