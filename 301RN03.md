## React Docs - Lists and Keys

1: Map() returns numbers doubled in value.

2: To loop through an array and display each value in JSX, one would:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);

(Assigned the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled). They can be built together with curly rackets.

3: A unique key.

4: Keys are used to specify items inside an array. Not out of an array.

## The Spread Operator

1: The spread operator is a useful syntax for adding items to arrays. Also for combining arrays or objects, and spreading the array out into the fuctions arguments.

2: The spread operator can do at least 8 tasks, but here are 4 of them:

Concatenating or combining arrays
Combining Objects
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React

3. An example from the article of concatenation / combining array (I am enjoying the emojis, just a little visual color, so apologies for my copy/paste).

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

4. Adding an item to an Array from the article:

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

Video: How to Pass Functions between Components

1. The first step he does to pass functions between components is create a function where the state is.

2: Increment loops through the array as the count updates due to how many times the array item was chosen.

3: Can pass a method from parent component to child component by creating this.increment.

4. The child component invokes the methos that was passed down by taking the name that was passed and it will be the one called / sent back up.
