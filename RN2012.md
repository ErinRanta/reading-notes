# Reading Notes-2, course 201, books by Jon Duckett

## HTML Duckett book:

### In the "text" chapter, we learn how to use tags in HTML. Below are some decriptors we can use for words in HTML:

1. Bold <b>
2. Italic <i>
Superscript <sup>
subscript <sub>
white Space (extra spaces)
Line Breaks <br />
Horizontal Rules <hr />

He also describes semantic markup for HTML, tags that add extra information to the page.
Examples are:

1.Strong <strong>
2. Emphasis (italic) <em>
3. Quotations <blockquote> or <q>
4. Abbreviations <abbr> and acronyms
5. Citations <cite>
6. Definitions <dfn>
7. Author Details <address>
8. Changes to Content <ins> & <del> & <s>

*The above is from the Jon Duckett book, pp.43-55

### "Intro to CSS":

In this chapter Duckett introcuces up to what CSS is. 
CSS brings color to the page! Takes a document from words, adds some style in the form of color, font, alignment, and more.
CSS describes by the "box" on an HTML file.
We can use CSS in it's own file, whic is usually how it is done. That way, it is clear to read and see where changes need to be made. especially when working in a group!
That is **External** CSS, whereas **Internal** is when it is written directly on an HTML file. Either in a section by "head" or even in an HTML specific line.

CSS is "Cascading Style Sheets" and cascade by the way the rules take place. the inheritance of the elements is such that when you specify, it will apply to the child elements.
Be on the lookout for quirks from different browesers for the CSS elements.

###  "Basic Javascript Instructions":

This chapter dives into the syntax and rules of Javascript.

The script consistes of statements. Statements are basically instructions, and each one should end with a semi-colon. In JS comments can be written to help humans understand what the code is trying to accomplish.
Variables is data that is held, but perhaps temporarily. The data can change each time the script runs. 
The instructions given to the computer must be very, very detailed.
By placing var in front of the variable that will be created, it tells the computer that that is what will be used. the = is used to assign value.
Strings are placed in quotes.
Boolean is somethings that is either true or false, and a variable can be used to store that data.
There are 6 rules for naming a variable Duckett writes about:

1. Must not start with a number
2. Can not contain dash or period.
3. No keywords used.
4. They are case sensitive!
5. Use a name that desccribes the information that is being stored!
6. Use a capital letter for second word in variable name.

We are introduced to Arrays in this chapter. An array staores a list of variables.
Expressions are reliant on operators, and "allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values," Duckett.
Javascript has mathmatical opertors, some are what we are familiar with from math, some are not, and string operators exist as well.

### "Decisions and Loops"

Kind of like "the Y in the road" there are moments when a decision will determine what happens next in code.
Flowcharts are made to help visualize this.
Ducket shows us the comparison operators, when the answer is a boolean (true or false).
In any condition there is one operator, and two operands.

Logical operators allow conparison of more than one comparison operator:

1. && logical and
2. || logical or
3. ! logical not

THe examples shown are very helpful, and I will look forward to trying them, as I absorb the way they work by trying. 

## Things I want to know more about:
I am curious how intricate I can make a background with CSS and how.
I wonder, so are comments really used frequently?
