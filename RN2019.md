# HTML FORMS

## Your First Web Form. How to Structure a Web Form:

 Web forms are important because they provide an opportunity for a user to enter date and allows the client at the same time gather that data. Page is refreshed after data entered.

Simplicity! Keeping the form simple is key for keeping users from getting frustrated and moving on. It’s also important to map it out in advance and think about who your user is.

5 form elements:
1. <form > officially states it’s a form!

2. The <action> attribute defines the location of where the form's collected. Data should be sent out out it is submitted.

3. The <method> attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).

4. <label> How you associate a form. Pretty literal...how it is labeled.

5. <input> is greatly influenced by type.

## Introduction to Events:

Events can be a variety of things. Imagine you are hovering your cursor, about to buy something but change your mind. That is an event. Clicking is an event, doubleclick is an event. Filling out data is an event, as is an error.

When using addListenerEvent, must provide the event we want to reigter, and the code that comprises the function.

Target is important in the Event Object because it is the DOM element that initiated the event.

Event bubbling and event capturing is different because bubbling, the event goes naturally up the line of ancestors. Capture phase is when it goes down to the element.

## Things I would like to know more about:
The tracking that can be done as events, like pausing the cursor...how much, if any, is being tracked without touching the keybord. By just being present?
