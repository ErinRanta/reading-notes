## React Lifecycle

1. The first event to happen is **render**

2. THe first event in a lifecycle in React is that the constructor() method is called.

3. The order in which these events happen is:
    1. constructor
    2. render
    3. componentDidMount
    4. react updates
    5. componentWillUnmount

4. The componentDidMount() method is where one can call a statement and the statement requires the component to be already in the DOM.

## React State vs Props

1. Pass things such as the initail count (counter component). Things we want to initialize component to, or want component to render like. Display to user, such as title and subtitle. Can rerender if the prop changes.

2. The main difference betyween props and state is that props pass into a component, while state is handled inside of the component.

3. The application is rerendered when the state is changed inside of the app. 
Can be useful for when we want the app to rerender when the user inputs.

4. Examples of what is stored in state include:
    -Data that we want to be continually updated based on user input
    -Data inside a form (checkbox, information, etc)., also use state to update according to user input.

## Things I would like to know more about:
A general answer, but I would like to practice all of this. I feel as thought this is going to be immensley useful. Just thinkng how often I, as a user, fill out forms (for instance) on on application helps me understand this.
