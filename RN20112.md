## Javascript Canvas

Along with the atributes width and height, <canvas> allows one to draw 2d graphics in Javascript. With canvas, one is able toaccess and change height and width using DOM methods.

As stated in the piece, the canvas tag differes from <img> because a closing tag IS required for "fallback" content in case a browser does not have the canvas tag (similar to "alt" in <img>.

It seems to me that by working together, getContext() and canvas to render and object. Canvas is blank at first, and getContext() does as it is called.

## Chart.js Documentation

Chart.js is a way to add animated graphs to one's HTML5 file. Needed is a script included on page with a <canvas> node to render the chart.

3. Radar Chart
